"I wanted to do this project"
This Application is made for OSS class's Assignment and my personal greed.

Fisrt tech is data collection application for traffic light's regularity.
How to collect data, I want to develop another app which is regularity data collect application.
this application works in camera app.
If you take a video for regularity, this app analogy the video and store that at database

/* // What to implement in the oss class<br>
Second tech is What we show on Google map based on previous data
print marker in latitude and longitude <br>
*/

Final tech is pedestrians are available this application which applies shortest distance algorithm

# Project Vision and Explaination
Navigation for pedestrians.
Nobody make navigation for pedestrians, only for car.
So I want to make navigation for pedestrians.
Traffic Light's regularity and When does it change color, It wastes time so much !

First, We collect data for trafficlight's regularity
So I want to make collecting data application based on image processing.

Second, Smart TrafficLight's don't have regularity. So I may collect data for contray.
If we are given the data, we use this data in program.

three, Shortest distance algorithm
I will make the navigation by applying the shortest distance algorithm.
The algorithm applying method is the shortest distance algorithm that takes time to arrive at each traffic light section.

# Introduction
It will be implemented in Java.
However, it was not implemented as open source.
So I can not introduce the license.

# Future Plans
This work is incomplete.
I could not write the source code because of the error.
It is because of the environment that was initially misunderstood.
So I will not make this application for class purposes, but I will make it an application that I sell later to make money.
In OSS class, it is regrettable not to be able to make this application.
